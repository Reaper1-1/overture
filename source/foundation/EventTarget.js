/**
    Mixin: O.EventTarget

    The EventTarget mixin allows you to add custom event support to any other
    class complete with support for bubbling. Simply add a `Mixin:
    O.EventTarget` property to your class. Then you can fire an event at any
    time by calling `this.fire('eventName')`. If you add a target to support
    bubbling, it is recommended you add a prefix to the name of your events, to
    distinguish them from those of other classes, e.g. the IO class fires
    `io:eventName` events.

        fired.

        Parameters:
            type   - {String} The name of the event to subscribe to.
            object - {(Function|Object)} The function to be called when the

    /**
        Method: O.EventTarget#fire

        Fires an event, causing all subscribed functions to be called with an
        event object as the single parameter and the scope bound to the object
        on which they subscribed to the event. In the case of subscribed
        object/method name pairs, the scope will remain the object on which the
        method is called.

        The event object contains the properties supplied in the details
        parameter and also a type attribute, with the type of the event, a
        target attribute, referencing the object on which the event was actually
        fired, a preventDefault function, which stops the default function
        firing if supplied, and a stopPropagation function, which prevents the
        event bubbling any further.

        Both parameters are optional, but at least one must be specified. If the
        `type` parameter is omitted, the `event` parameter must be an `Event` or
        `O.Event` instance, and its `type` property will be used.

        Parameters:
            type  - {String} (optional) The name of the event being fired.
            event - {Event|O.Event|Object} (optional) An event object or object
                    of values to be added to the event object.

        Returns:
            {O.EventTarget} Returns self.
